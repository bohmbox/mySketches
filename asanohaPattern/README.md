I just found out that the name of this beautiful pattern is called Asanoha (Asa no ha) and it's japanese. 

I even found a tutorial on how to draw it with simple figures and lines. 

I will try to replicate it with processing. Later, with what I learnt doing it, I will try to recreate it in a modular way, extended to the entire screen space.
