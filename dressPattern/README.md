This is another example of a great tesellated design. I don't know what is that lures me into these patterns but I will continue to replicate patterns such as this.

It's great. However, now I see that this tesselation will need additional knowledge and cleverness. It's not going to be as easy as it appeared at the beginning.

And the reason why, is because I have 2 different shapes that are complementary, I have hexagons and I have lines. I could go and create the pattern with lines but then I would need to color the hexagon shapes. Or I could create the shapes and then I would need to extend the lines that connect the hexagons, and everything would need to fit.
