This is an example found on Ira Greenberg's book (Processing: creative coding and computational art) regarding class inheritance. 

Here the idea was to explore the inheritance concept for object oriented programming applied to Processing. 
In its first iteration, two classes were created: Shape and Polygon. 

The idea is to extend the Shape class with the Polygon subclass, and get to the Shape methods applied to Polygon objects.

Eventually the idea is to incorporate these principles in a future sketch.
