I started reading this other book called Algorithms for visual design, by Kostas Tersidis (2009), which is a great book as it has problems for students. One of the problems I found was about modular operations, that is, using the modulo % binary operation. 

The problem was to come up with an operation that would give the next pattern

11101110111011101110

which seems like an easy one, given that it is multiples of 4, but not so easy because the 1, 1, 1 are not so simple to find. So, this sketch is about the creation of such pattern.

After a thougthful consideration, I think the main objective of this skectch will be to explore, as in bar diagrams, how the different modular expressions perform. I will add a text description on each representation.
