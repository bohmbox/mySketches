One idea I had is integrating my processing sketches with my portfolio project. This is one example that I thougth about to represent the microcontroller section.

This sketch represents a chip, with its pads connected in a random way to wiring, and a different behaviour for the connection any time the user clicks on the image. 

It is just a microcontroller chip at the center of a white screen. And every time the user clicks on the image, a series of connections between the chip legs and the surrounding environment is being made.
