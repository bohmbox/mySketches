This sketch is presented in the page 165 of the Greenberg2005 book. (Processing- Creative coding and computational art)

I just noticed that I don't feel like I have advanced much from reading this book, with which I am now invested.

I don't have typed down a bunch of sketches of previous chapters. I assume this is also why I'm kinda stuck with this book.

Well. Enjoy.
