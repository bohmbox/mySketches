In this pattern what I did was replicate the code I saw in the book I'm studying: Processing Creative coding and computational art, by Ira Greenberg, but I tried to do so just based in the final outcome, without typing the code exactly as the author. 

Important thing to notice in this code is the use of mouseX and mouseY to control the parameters of the trig function.
