Inspired by a geometric pattern I saw in the streets incorporating spirals in its design, I took the opportunity to sketch some spirals. 

In the process I found a way with a short example included in the book Reas2014, Processing: a programming handbook for visual designers and artists, 2nd ed.   

This example generates a spiral on the screen, this spiral changes two of its parameters with the mouse movement. 

This is the result.
