# processing sketches
I wanted so badly to learn how to create cool stuff with Processing, the software application for creative coders and digital artist. 

Besides that, I have found I have a huge interest in the visual arts, patterns and design. Based on that, every now and then I stumble upon a curious drawing, a lovely color pallette, a superb design or pattern that I want to emulate trough my code canvas. So, here I am, sharing the processing sketches I made along my learning path.

And given that I want to enter the tech industry I thought it would be a great idea to just go ahead and kill two birds with one shot by learning this superb language framework while I hone my coding skills. 

Welcome!
