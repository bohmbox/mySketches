# processing sketches
I wanted so badly to learn how to create cool stuff with Processing, the software application for creative coders and digital artist. 

And given that I want to enter the tech industry I thought it would be a great idea to just go ahead and kill two birds with one shot by learning this superb language framework while I hone my coding skills. 

So, here I am, sharing the processing sketches I made along my learning path.
